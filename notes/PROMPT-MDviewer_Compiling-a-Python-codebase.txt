“You are acting as a build agent. Compile the Python project using the existing PyInstaller .spec file located at  C:\Users\jimur\Projects\MDviewer\MDviewer.spec.
Use PyInstaller in ‘spec mode’ (e.g., pyinstaller MDviewer.spec).
Do not regenerate or modify the .spec file.
Run the build in the project root, and report any build errors verbatim.
After the build completes, list the output artifacts and their locations.”
